Four images on the page will be buttons


Page loads a random number between 19 and 120 using math.random, and appends that number to a div in the HTML


When the player clicks one of the buttons, an onclick event will add feed a number of points between 1 and 12 to the score.
The score is the sum of the button clicks, and is appended to a div in the HTML. 


Each time the game restarts, the buttons will have new point values.

When the random number == the score, the player wins and the game resets.


If the score > the random number, the player loses and the game resets.


The number of wins and loses should add up on the page.
