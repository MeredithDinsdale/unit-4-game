Trivia Game Instructions:

The set-up...
On each page, you will find "specimen" images that can be clicked. 
There are two numbers: Risk threshold (a randomly generated number), and accumulated risk (initializes to zero). 
There is also a collection counter that lists the accumulating quantities of the collected specimens. 
Each of the "specimen" images is associated with a random number. When the image is clicked, that number is added to the accumulated risk.

The objective...
The goal is to have the accumulated risk equal the risk threshold. If the accumulated risk goes over the risk threshold, the user loses the game. 

Use the navigation images on the welcome page, or the navigation buttons in the nav bar to visit different parts of the island and play the game in different settings.
